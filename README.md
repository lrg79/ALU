An 32 bit arithmetic logic unit I created in my systems architecture class using logisim. To view this, please download logisim evolution, and open then open this file in that program. The link to download logisim evolution is also uploaded in this respository. The link to download the jar file is here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/logisimevolution/
